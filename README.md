Web Application to predict if you need to bring a umbrella to work or not. This app uses Heroku to build and distribute.

## Functionality
This app uses the Open weather map API to get the latest weather forecasts and then show you if you need to bring a umbrella or not on that given date. The app shows you the three hour forecasts for the next 5 days,
a days average temperature and if you need to bring a umbrella or not (If it is going to rain under three hours during that day). The app is also searchable and can show the weather forecasts for several places in Sweden.

## TODOS
* Add "save current location as favorite" Option to store favorite locations.
* Major rework of the Interface to make it more appealing and a better desktop version.
* Add support for other countries besides Sweden.
